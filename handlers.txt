handlers:

it is one of conditional forms
it is similar to task  but it only run if notified by a task
a task will fire the notification, if ansible recognizes task state changes
handlers will run after all of the tasks are run and then only runs even if they are
notified multiple times
handlers are we use in ansible for restart service and reboot.

handlers:
  - name: restart nginx
    service: name:nginx state:restarted
