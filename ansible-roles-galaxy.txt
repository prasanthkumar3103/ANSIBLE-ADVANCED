I wanted to have apache webserver ,to have that we do by using galaxy,

since i dont want to download from galaxy, i say initialize offline.


1.ansible-galaxy init apache --offline

[root@ansible-control-server roles]# tree
.
+-- apache
    +-- defaults
    ¦   +-- main.yml
    +-- files
    +-- handlers
    ¦   +-- main.yml
    +-- meta
    ¦   +-- main.yml
    +-- README.md
    +-- tasks
    ¦   +-- main.yml
    +-- templates
    +-- tests
    ¦   +-- inventory
    ¦   +-- test.yml
    +-- vars
        +-- main.yml

components:-
-------------
1.default = data about the role/application(meaning default variables used here)
ex: webserver port i wanna run on 80
2.files= we put the static file to send nodes/copy on remote machine
3.handlers= task which are based on some actions. triggers.
ex:-in case my config file changes of apache, service should restart,so, that code
will be written here.
4.meta= who is the author of the role/on which platform it is supported
ex: information about role,author name,supported platforms etc dependency
5.task= core logic or code will be stored here
6.template: will store dynamic files(meaing as per node)
ex: we write using jinja2 templates
7.vars= both vars and defaults stores variables, variables stored under "vars"
has got high priority and difficult to override.
