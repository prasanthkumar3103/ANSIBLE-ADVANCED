ansible vault:
--------------

we dont have coding excercise for ansible vault

#inventory file -inventory.txt

db_server	ansible_ssh_pass=Passw0rd	ansible_host=192.168.1.1
web_server	ansible_ssh_pass=Passw0rd	ansible_host=192.168.1.2


we've been storing credentials using to connect servers in a plain text format so far.
maintaining in plaintext file is not best practice


ansible-valut encrypt inventory.txt #  it will ask for password to encrypt


ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory.txt # it will throw an error since its encrypt

ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory.txt -ask-vault-pass

ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory.txt -vault-password=file ~./vault_pass.txt

security reasons we can maintain it in python file
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory.txt -vault-password=file ~./vault_pass.py

content view of encrypt file
ansible-vault view inventory.txt

create valut
ansible-vault create inventory.txt
