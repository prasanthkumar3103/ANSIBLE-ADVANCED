Why?

role is a way of developing playbook
roles are organized in standard structure
role are quite re-usable
role can be shared to other(git/)


we dont have to use include command if we're using roles.

in roles playbook looks simple and readable 

in stead of single playbook, we seperate it multiple roles, we can reuse for different use
ex: if someone want to deploy db server,webserver this role design helps us.


ansible-galaxy init webserver

webserver
  Readme.md  :-
  test:
  tasks
  handlers
  vars
  default : stores default variable values



  ansible-galaxy init mysql_db
  ansible-galaxy init flask_web
